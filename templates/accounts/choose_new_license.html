<h1>Freesound Bulk License Change</h1>

<p>Hi! It looks like this is the first time you sign into freesound "2", or "nightingale" like we like to call it. For a while friendly people at <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">creative commons</a> have been telling us that the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sampling+/1.0/">Sampling+ license</a> used in Freesound "1" is a pretty silly license, especially for sounds for various technical lawyer reasons... We totally agree with this and are helping creative commons to release the world of this license...</p>

<p>Freesound "2" now gives you the option of selecting one of 3 licenses and we want you to change all your sound licenses to one of this 3 licenses before you continue. This might sound dramatic, but it isn't really. The terminology used in these new licenses is much clearer and there are fewer grey areas, so we will get less questions....</p>

<p><b>Please note:</b> of course you can still change sounds individually afterwards, that speaks for itself!</p>

<p><b>Remember:</b> no matter what license, you are always free to give people exceptions, or license your work elsewhere under another license. If you select the strictest license, people will need to go through the motions of asking you permission to use their work for certain things, and this might be troublesome...</p>
