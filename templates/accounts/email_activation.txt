Thank you for signing up at Freesound.org!

*** Please note!!! ********************************************************************
     You have signed up for the BETA version of Freesound that is currently
     running at http://tabasco.upf.edu/. Please be advised that these accounts
     will be lost once we release the final version of Freesound 2. If you already
     have a Freesound 1 account (that's not too new), please use that one
     to log in to Freesound 2.

     To all API hackers: API keys for accounts that existed in Freesound 1 will
     be backported. API keys for accounts created in Freesound 2 will be lost in the
     final release. We will however give you a heads up when this will happen
     so you can prepare changing the API key in your application.

If for some reason this fails, try copy-pasting the complete link into you browser. Some mail clients break up long lines, or do strange things to URL's!
