    <h3>Introducing Freesound terms of use</h3>

    <p>Hello dear Freesound users!</p>

    <p>After almost eight years of great sounds and constant growth
    it has become necessary to create a terms of use for Freesound.
    These terms are intented to outline the legal aspects
    of Freesound and to clarify your rights as users, our privacy policy
    and, in general, to protect you and us against incorrect uses of the site.
    </p>

    <p>By adding these terms of use <b>we have not changed the philosophy
    of the site</b>. It is just a necessary step to keep on growing and
    improving Freesound! However, if you want to discuss any particular concerns you have about the
    terms you're more than welcome to start a discussion in the forums.
    </p>

    <p>In order to continue using Freesound you'll have to accept
    <a href="/help/tos_web/" target="_blank">these terms of use</a>. But hey, don't
    worry because they are not excessively long to read and we have also created a <a href="/help/tos_web/" target="_blank">friendly version</a>
    of the terms which makes them much easier to understand. Here is a brief summary of the terms:
