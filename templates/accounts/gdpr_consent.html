    <h3>GDPR Updates to our Privacy Policy</h3>

    <p>Hello dear Freesound user!</p>

    <p>You'll have seen by now that many websites have updated their privacy policy because of the new
        <a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/" target="_blank">EU General Data Proetion Regulation</a> (or GDPR for short).
        Well, Freesound is not an exception and here we are happily asking you to give us your consent on the
        updated policy :)
    </p>

    <p>
        The updated terms of the privacy policy are intented to clarify your rights as users, the ways in which we
        process your data and, in general, to protect you and us against incorrect uses of the site. This update of
        the privacy policy does not alter the Freesound philosophy at all, it is just a necessary step that we need
        to make in order to comply with the new regulations.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please, take some time to read our <a href="/help/tos_web/" target="_blank">terms of use</a> and
        the updated <a href="/help/privacy/" target="_blank">updated privacy policy</a>.
        We prepared a brief summary of them which we include here:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Uploaded sounds are released under one of the CC licenses you choose.
        Other content (metadata, tags, comments, etc...) is provided as CC-Zero.</li>
        <li>Your activity in Freesound is public and can be seen by all users (except your private messages).</li>
        <li>You are responsible for your posted content.</li>
        <li>We (Freesound) keep your data confidential and apply security measures to keep this confidentiality.</li>
        <li>We (Freesound) donâ€™t warrant that all the data on the site is correct.
            We are not liable for information not posted by us on this site.</li>
        <li>We (Freesound) may remove accounts of users that do not comply with the terms or who do not
            behave correctly (spam, offensive comments...).</li>
        <li>We can use anonymized data collected from Freesound (statistics about sounds, tags, comments, downloads...)
        for research purposes.</li>
        <li>You agree to receive email notifications from us.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>

        using Freesound as usual. Thank you for your patience and understanding, we really appreciate the commitment
