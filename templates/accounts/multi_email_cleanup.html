    <h1>Your email address should be updated</h1>

    <p>Dear <b>{{ request.user.username }}</b>, we recently introduced a new policy in Freesound which does not allow
        different user accounts to share a single email address. Only a few users are affected by this change, and you
        happen to be one of them. But don't worry, the fix is easy ;)</p>

    <p>We changed the email address of your user to be <b>{{ request.user.email }}</b>.<br>
       Your original email address was <b>{{ original_email }}</b>.
       Here is the list of the accounts which were using this address:</p>

    <ul>
    {% for user in other_users %}
        <li><a href="{% url 'account' user.username %}">{{ user.username }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

    <p>To fix this issue
        All what you have to do is to either set a new email using the <a href="{% url 'accounts-email-reset' %}">reset
        email form</a>, or submit a <a href="{% url 'contact' %}">support request</a> telling us your username
        and the new email you want to use for your account.</p>
