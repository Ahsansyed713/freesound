                Permission has been granted to application <strong>{{ app_name }}</strong>.
                In order to comple the full authentication process the application will require you to introduce the following authorization code:
            </p>

            <div style="font-size:20px;font-family:'Courier';text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px">{{ code }}</div>

            <p>
                Once the code is introduced, the API application will have permissions to acces your data.
                Permissions can be revoked at any time by visiting your settings page.
            </p>

        {% else %}

            <h1>Ops! there were some errors...</h1>
            <p>You should probably start again the authorization process from the 3rd party application!</p>
