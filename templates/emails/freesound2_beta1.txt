Hi {{ username }},

As you might know, we have been working on a new version of the Freesound
website for quite a while now. Well, guess what, it's almost there!

We have a beta version online and we wanted to ask the most active Freesound
users (and you are one of them) for feedback before we go live with the final
version. You can help us out by testing the new web site and writing us with
your feedback and any thoughts you might have. We would greatly appreciate it!

    The beta is online at: http://tabasco.upf.edu

When you browse the site you will notice many changes:

  - Completely new design
  - New audio player
  - New search
  - Uploads through the web site, no more FTP
  - New way of listening and browsing the remixes
  - An easy to use API

If you are a developer you will especially like the new API. It will allow
anyone to create new applications on top of Freesound. For example, check out
the Freesoundscapes application by @tamat at http://www.tamats.com/apps/mhd/.

A note of warning: like the banner on tabasco says, everything you do on
the beta site will be lost once we switch freesound.org to the new version!
But, please, don't let that hold you back from trying all of the new features.

Please, send any feedback, thoughts, or questions you might have to fs2@freesound.org

Greetings,

- The Really Proud Freesound Development Team
