It is the de facto standard for \"high\" quality audio storage that ensures the highest compatibility amongst different OSs (win, mac, linux). In addition virtually all DAWs and sound editing programs can handle well this format and use it as default.<br /> \r\nIf you're interested in the inner workings of this format have a look at the excellent wikipedia page:  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wav\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wav</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name=\"aiff\">AIFF</a><br /> This is a similar format to WAV. Once again non-compressed,loseless and using pulse code modulation (PCM), although there are variants that are compressed. In is again in wide usage by software editing programs. It is usually the default format when working with Macs but it is accepted in windows systems as well.<br />For a detailed description have a look here: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIFF\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIFF</a> \r\n\r\n<a name=\"ogg\">OGG</a><br /> This is actually the VORBIS format but it is used in conjunction with the ogg container, hence usually just called \"ogg\" or \"ogg vorbis\". It is a lossy audio format but is said to have very good quality compared to other lossy audio formats, especially for low bit rates. More information can be found in the relevant wikipedia article <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg_vorbis\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg_vorbis</a>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"mp3\">MP3</a> <br /> This is undoubtedly the most well know audio format. It is a lossy format and as all lossy format a so called perceptual format. The quality varies a lot depending on the settings used in the encoding. In general it is not used in audio editing but is nevertheless used widely on the internet, for streaming, as well as in games. There is a lot of information regarding the MP3 audio format but a good starting point would be as usual the wikipedia article: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mp3\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mp3</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name=\"mp3\">FLAC</a> <br /> \r\nThis audio format is a bit different in the sense that is uses a lossless data compression algorithm. So it can be compressed, usually to 50%-60% of the original size and decompressed to an exact copy of the original audio. It is open ad royalty free but unfortunately does not enjoy a wide support such as the WAV and AIFF audio formats.

            "body": "The bitdepth is an important but a bit a confusing concept since its use varies among audio formats.\r\nThe \"classical\" meaning is applicable to PCM style encodings. When refering to mp3 or other lossy type formats and DSD type formats the bitdepth is not used in the same way. When referring to formats such as wav or aiff the bitdepth is crucial to the dynamic range that is \"encoded\" in the sound. \r\n\r\nCommon Audio Bit Depths\r\n\r\n - <b>16-bit</b>. The most common bitdepth used. This is the standard CD quality bitdepth. Theoretically it provides for a dynamic range of 96dB.\r\n - <b>8-bit</b>. Not used anymore apart from telephone audio. Where 8-bit/8kHz is still the standard.\r\n - <b>24-bit</b>. Used in DAT, DVD-Audio and supported in most modern DAWs and sound editing programs. It provides for 144dB dynamic range which exceeds the human hearing capabilities.\r\n\r\nFor a detailed explanation on bit rates and their importance have a look at this wikipedia article:\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_bit_depth\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_bit_depth</a>",

            "body": "The sample rate is crucial to the sound quality. To better understand the importance of the sampling rate we need to have an understanding of the Nyquistâ€“Shannon sampling theorem. In short it states that perfect reconstruction of a signal is possible when the sampling frequency is greater than twice the maximum frequency of the signal being sampled. So in the case of audio, since the humans can hear up to sounds of 20kHz, a 40kHz sample rate allows for perfect reconstruction of the original signal. Nevertheless the standard is not 40kHz but 44100 Hz as explained below <br /><br />\r\n<b>44100 Hz</b><br />\r\nThis is the de facto standard as set by Sony after a debate between Sony and Philips. \r\nAlthough soundcards and programs now support much higher sampling rates the 44100 is still the standard when the final mixdown is ready for distribution. This is the sample frequency CDs use. <br >\r\n<br />\r\n<b>48000 Hz</b><br />\r\nNowdays DVD and other consumer video formats use 48000 Hz as well. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThere is a lot to be said about sampling frequencies, their applications and reasoning to choose one over another.
