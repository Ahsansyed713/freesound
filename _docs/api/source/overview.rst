Overview (APIv2)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Welcome to the Freesound APIv2 docummentation!

The APIv2 brings many new features such as OAuth authentication, sound uploads and
improved search options. APIv2 is still in a beta phase so it might not be completely reliable.
Docummentation is still incomplete and we haven't released any client libraries yet.
Therefore, use it at your own risk! ;)

We recommend you to have a look at the (incomplete) :ref:`resources` page and to
have a look at the browseable api (http://www.freesound.org/apiv2) to quickly understand how
the new API works. You'll need to be logged in in Freesound to be able to use the browseable API.

In order to start using APIv2 you'll need an API key that you can request in (http://www.freesound.org/apiv2/apply).
API keys given for APIv2 can ALSO be used for APIv2.
If you have any questions or doubts you can post them in our mailing list http://groups.google.com/group/freesound-api.
