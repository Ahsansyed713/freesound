Freesound provides new and interesting ways of accessing these samples, allowing users to:\r\n\r\n-   browse the sounds in new ways using keywords, a \"sounds-like\" type of browsing and more\r\n-   upload and download sounds to and from the database, under the same creative commons license\r\n-   interact with fellow sound-artists!\r\n\r\nWe also aim to create an open database of sounds that can also be used for scientific research. Many audio research institutions have trouble finding correctly licensed audio to test their algorithms. Many have voiced this problem, but so far there hasn't been a solution.\r\n\r\n##Help##\r\n\r\nWe are preparing the help pages for the new Freesound. Meanwhile, you can still browse the old forum [FAQ and Documentation](http://tabasco.upf.edu/forum/faq-and-documentation/) thread and find useful information.\r\n\r\n##Developers##\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in contributing with the development of Freesound or are planning to program an application using the Freesound API, please check out the [developers help page](http://tabasco.upf.edu/help/developers/).\r\n",

You can manage your existing API keys or apply for a new one in the following url [http://tabasco.upf.edu/api/apply](http://tabasco.upf.edu/api/apply) (Freesound login is required).\r\n\r\nThe API documentation describing offered functionalities and examples can be found here [http://tabasco.upf.edu/docs/api](http://tabasco.upf.edu/docs/api). We have also implemented [client libraries](http://tabasco.upf.edu/docs/api/client_libs.html) for Python, Actionscript and Javascript that provide an even easier way to access the Freesound API.\r\n\r\nIf you need more help after reading the documentation or want to stay up to date on any changes or future feaures of the Freesound API or if you would like to request more features for the API, please use our google group: [http://groups.google.com/group/freesound-api](http://groups.google.com/group/freesound-api).\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n\r\n##[Apply](http://tabasco.upf.edu/api/apply)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Docs](http://tabasco.upf.edu/docs/api)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Help](http://groups.google.com/group/freesound-api)##\r\n\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n##Contribute to the development of Freesound##\r\n\r\nFreesound is an open-source project and we will be very happy to get more people involved in its development! We coordinate using an [Assembla public repository](https://www.assembla.com/spaces/freesound) to host the code, organize the work to do and discuss about specific implementation aspects. Furthermore, we also have a google group to discuss about more general ideas and future directions of Freesound ([http://groups.google.com/group/freesound-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/freesound-dev)). If you want to contribute, don't hesitate to contact us!\r\n",
